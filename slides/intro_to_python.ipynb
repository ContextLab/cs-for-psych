        "This notebook provides a very high level overview of what it means to \"write a computer program,\" and some specific examples of how to write a program in Python (using Jupyter notebooks).  If you are already familiar with Python and Jupyter notebooks, you might be interested in [this video](https://youtu.be/Gin8_AITmS0) summarizing some tips and tricks for writing good, clean, effective code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: this tutorial is intended to introduce you to the basics-- not to provide a complete, or even fully self-contained, overview of Python programming.  If this material is new to you, then after running through this notebook, I suggest that you work through a beginner Python tutorial like [this one](https://gitlab.erc.monash.edu.au/andrease/Python4Maths/tree/master/Intro-to-Python).  We'll also cover this material in class, but the best way to learn how to program is through repeated and varied exposure.\n",

        "### A note on how to approach learning to code\n",
        "\n",
        "Like any new skill, learning to code can be daunting.  If you've never coded or taken courses on logic before, you might be about to embark on a journey towards an entirely new way of thinking and approaching problem solving.  I've found four general principles to be useful:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  The first time you go through something, don't expect to understand everything (or even anything) perfectly.  Sometimes going through a new lesson or example might seem like encountering a foreign language (hint: maybe because it *is*!).  Give yourself permission relax and to *not* understand.  Not \"getting it\" the first time doesn't reflect on your intelligence or potential.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  If you're feeling lost, it's important to notice your points of confusion (even if you don't immediately correct or resolve them).  One of the most powerful ways of approaching coding is to break highly complex tasks down into successively simpler sub-tasks.  You don't always need to understand the full scope of the problem you're working on-- you just need to understand enough to break off a tiny piece of the next step in the puzzle.  By the same token, approach *learning* as a problem solving journey.  Try to take stock of what you're not understanding, and carefully separate the material into \"things you know (sufficiently well)\" and \"things you don't know\".  Use what you know to help further sub-divide the unknowns.  Your goal should be to work towards an ability to precisely formulate questions.  That will help you resolve your understanding (either by searching for the answer online or by asking others for help).  Particularly when you're starting out, it's also OK not to know how to break your questions down into smaller chunks.  You'll pick it up as you go.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  The best predictor of successfully learning to code is *persistence*.  Simply allowing yourself to be exposed to code (by reading and writing it, and by going through tutorials, etc.) will improve your ability to understand, even if those improvements aren't immediately obvious or noticeable to you.  One way to view the learning process is as a way of building up your *fluency* (through repeated exposure) in addition to adding the basic building blocks and vocabulary to your skill set.  Even if you're not adding new building blocks, simply gaining more exposure will improve your fluency.  Over time this will make it easier for you to add new building blocks.  Each new step you take in the learning process will allow you to gain a deeper understanding of previously learned material, and will help you to learn new material that much faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  The best way to learn to code is to *write code*.  When you're reading through a new tutorial or about a new idea, keep a Jupyter notebook open and code as you learn.  And once you've learned about something new, try to apply it to a question or problem you're excited about.  The potential applications of any given idea are nearly limitless.  Allow yourself the freedom to get creative, make mistakes, break things, and try out new stuff!"

For example, you can type in an equation, and when you \"run\" that line of code (`shift + return`) the answer is printed to the console window.  Explore which operators (addition, subtraction, etc.) are supported and see if you can find some that aren't!

A _function_ is a special data type that takes in zero or more _arguments_ (i.e. inputs) and produces zero or more actions or outputs.\n",

In other words, the parameters of the condition that is being tested for should be adjusted each time the loop executes another cycle.  If the loop condition never changes its value from `True`, the `while` loop will continue looping forever; this is called an `infinite loop`.  Infinite loops will freeze your computer program until they are manually halted by pressing `ctrl + c`.\n",

        "### Nested loops\n",
        "Both `for` and `while` loops may themselves contain other loops (of either type).  For example, nested loops can be useful when you want to carry out some sequence of operations on each _combination_ of a set of things."
