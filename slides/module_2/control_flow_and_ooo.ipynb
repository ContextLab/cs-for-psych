        "# Control flow and order of operations\n",
        "\n",
        "In the [Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and Python](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ContextLab/cs-for-psych/blob/master/slides/module_1/intro_to_python.ipynb) tutorial we introduced two types of control flow constructs:\n",
        "- `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for selectively executing or skipping code according to whether a specified set of conditions is satisfied\n",
        "- `while` and `for` loops for repeating instructions while a given condition is satisfied and/or for a given number of times\n",
        "\n",
        "In that tutorial we also briefly reviewed the [order of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations) in which statements are combined and evaluated, in the context of mathmatical operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook we'll explore some additional control flow instructions and strategies, and we will dig a bit deeper into some Python-specific aspects of the order of operations.  These concepts are central to designing efficient, functional, and readable code.  We will be interleaving the discussion of control flow and order of operations throughout the notebook, since both of these broad concepts are closely related.  Specifically, the order of operations is a key factor in determining how a program proceeds, which parts are executed, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "# A deeper dive into `if`, `elif`, and `else`\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the following two blocks of code:\n",
        "\n",
        "*Block 1:*\n",
        "```\n",
        "if <condition 1>:\n",
        "  <body 1>\n",
        "elif <condition 2>:\n",
        "  <body 2>\n",
        "elif <condition 3>:\n",
        "  <body 3>\n",
        "else:\n",
        "  <body 4>\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "*Block 2:*\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "if <condition 1>:\n",
        "  <body 1>\n",
        "if <condition 2>:\n",

        "  <body 3>\n",

        "  <body 4>\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "At first glance, both look similar.  In fact, often the two blocks of code may appear to perform identically (with respect to execution time and functionality).  However, it is important to note that the two blocks of code are **not** equivalent.  Let's break down each block line-by-line.\n",
        "\n",
        "In *Block 1*, the interpreter begins with the first if statement and evaluates `<condition 1>`.  This can be any statement or function call, as long as the statement (or function) evaluates to `True`, `False`, or something that can be typecasted into `True` or `False`.  The flexibility in syntax is worth appreciating.  For example, suppose that the function specified in the conditional statement took an hour to evaluate.  You'd need to wait an hour in order for the interpreter to determine whether the body of the if statement should run or not.  Because any given statement might take a long time to evaluate, it's important to consider when each statement will be executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "If `<condition 1>` is true, `<body 1>` executes and the `if-elif-else` block completes.  If instead `<condition 1>` isn't true, the interpreter next moves on to the first `elif` statement and evaluates `<condition 2>`.  This process continues:\n",
        "- if a given condition is true, the corresponding statements in the body of the `if` or `elif` statement are executed and no further conditions are evaluated\n",
        "- if a given condition is false, the interpreter moves on to evaluate the next condition\n",
        "- if all of the `if` and `elif` conditions are false, the body of the `else` statement is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "In *Block 2* things work a little differently.  Like in *Block 1*, the interpreter first evaluates `<condition 1>`, and runs `<body 1>` if that conditional is true.  However, regardless of whether `<condition 1>` is true, in *Block 2* (because the second statement is an `if` statement rather than an `elif` statement), the second `if` statement will *always* be evaluated.  This is also true of the third and fourth `if` statements in *Block 2*.  Finally, the body of the `else` statement in *Block 2* will be executed as long as `<condition 3>` is false-- regardless of whether the other conditions are true or false.\n",
        "\n",
        "If each condition is mutually exclusive (i.e., at most one condition can be true at a time), both blocks will behave identically.  However, if two or more conditions may be true simultaneously, the two code blocks will diverge.  For example, suppose that both `<condition 1>` and `<condition 2>` are true:\n",
        "  - In *Block 1* only `<body 1>` will be executed, and `<condition 2>` (and beyond) will never be evaluated.\n",
        "  - In *Block 2*, both `<body 1>` and `<body 2>` will be executed, and both `<condition 1>` and `<condition 2>` will be evaluated.  Further, `<body 4>` will also be evaluated, because the `else` statement in *Block 2* refers to the *third if statement*-- i.e. it runs if `<condition 3>` is false, no matter what the other conditions evaluate to.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider how the two blocks of code will behave under other scenarios:\n",
        "- `<condition 1>`, `<condition 2>`, and `<condition 3>` are all `True`\n",
        "- `<condition 3>` is `True` but the others are `False`\n",
        "- `<condition 1>` is `True` but the others are `False`\n",
        "- `<condition 1>`, `<condition 2>`, and `<condition 3>` are all `False`\n",

Then the first conditional would evaluate to `False`, and the second conditional (typecasting `x` into an `int` and comparing its value to 3) could be evaluated.  If `x` were greater than or equal to 3, the second conditional would evaluate to `True` and the third conditional wouldn't be evaluated.  By contrast, if `convert_to_int(x)` were less than 3, then this could potentially cause an error when the third conditional was evaluated (and `x` was treated as a function).\n",
