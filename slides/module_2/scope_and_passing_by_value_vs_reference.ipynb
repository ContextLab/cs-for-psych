Python isn't omniscient or psychic; it can't know what a particular name refers to unless it's either built-in (in which case the implementation of Python itself provides an association between the name of the variable and the object it's referring to), or unless you've explicitly told Python what the name refers to.

        "A *workspace* is a set of named variables that the interpreter currently has access to.  When Python starts, the default workspace provides access only to built-in Python functions and named variables.  When you `import` new libraries, the command adds the functions and variables defined in those libraries to the current workspace.  One way to think about the workspace is to imagine it looking like a [blueberry pancake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake).  The \"cake\" part of the pancake provides a framework for the variables (blueberries) to sit in.  By looking down at the top of the pancake, you can see (access) each variable/blueberry.  The total set of variables available in the workspace is the set of blueberries that you can see when you look down at the top of the pancake.  You can view them using the `dir` command.\n",
        "\n",
        "New workspaces are created when you enter the body of a [compound statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html)---i.e. an `if`, `elif`, `else`, `for`, `while`, function or class definitions, etc. statement where multiple lines are indented to indicate they're grouped together.  Specifically, the code inside the statement body gets a new workspace, like throwing another pancake onto the stack.  Any variables defined inside the statement body get put into the top-most pancake.  When the body of the compound statement ends, the corresponding pancake (workspace) is discarded, along with any of its associated variables.  This means, for example, that if you define a new variable inside of a function, it will only be accessible *within that function* (or any compound statements within that function).  But once the function exits, its workspace is discarded and its corresponding variables aren't accessible anymore.\n",
        "\n",
        "The one \"trick,\" and a place where the pancake analogy breaks down somewhat, is that in addition to the top-most workspace (pancake), Python can also access any pancakes *below* that one (i.e., that the given workspace or its ancestors were defined in).\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we know that workspaces are like blueberry pancakes, the above examples should be clear, right?  Let's go through them line by line, using `dir` to print out the changing workspaces:\n"

        "If we were to modify the contents of the computer's memory at the linked-to location, `x` would then have a different value in all subsequent computations.

Or does the *reference* to the location get passed to the function instead?  These two possibilities are called *passing by value* and *passing by reference*, respectively.  To foreshadow, Python always passes by reference.

The value of `x['a']` stored at those new locations would then be modified inside of `myfunc2`.  Finally, the assignment statement assigns the (new) locations in memory (containing those modified values) to the named variable `y`.  Because only the values in the new memory locations were updated, we're left with two different `dict` objects afer the above code executes: `x` holds its original values, where `a` is 1, whereas `y` holds the updated values, where `a` is 2.

        "Now let's walk through what happens when `x` is passed by reference instead of by value.  Inside the body of `myfunc2`, the `x` variable points to the *same* memory location as the `x` variable assigned before the function is defined.  The function call then modifies the value of `a` stored at `x`'s location in memory.  When the function returns, the variable `y` is linked to the same location in memory as `x`.  Therefore both `x` and `y` will now have `a` equal to 2, since both of those variables actually refer to the same location in memory.  In fact, if we call `x['a'] = 3` after the `y = myfunc2(x)` line, the value of `y['a']` will change to 3 as well!  If `x` and `y` both refer to the same location in memory, changing the values stored at that location will change *both* `x` and `y`.\n",

        "Calling `copy.deepcopy(x)` takes the values stored at the location refered to by `x`, copies them to a new memory location, and returns a reference to that new location.  In the example, that new location is then passed to `myfunc2`.  When the interpreter enters `myfunc2`, both the old location (of `x`) and the new location (returned by `copy.deepcopy`) contain the same values, but those values are stored at different physical locations in memory.  Becaues `myfunc2` only modifies the values stored at the new location, the original values of `x` remain unchanged.\n",

        "In this simple example, there is little cost to copying `x`'s value to a new location in memory.  However, when a variable occupies a lot of space in memory (e.g. more than can fit in [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory)), the `copy.deepcopy` operation can take a long time to run.  Therefore the design decision to pass everything by reference in Python helps to make Python code run faster (and require less memory) than if variables were instead passed by value (requiring constant copying).  Nevertheless, sometimes it's necessary to maintain separate copies (e.g., pre- and post-modification), and in those scenarios the cost of running `copy.deepcopy` may be warranted."
