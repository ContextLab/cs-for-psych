        "\n",
        "Python is an [object-oriented programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).  This means that each construct and datatype in Python (variables, operators, functions, etc.) is an instance of a computational *object*: an entity that can store data, have attributes, carry out functions, execute code, etc.  Conceptually, Python code defines a set of computational objects and the rules that govern how they interact.  This way of thinking and programming is inspired by ideas about how the physical world operates-- e.g., where the universe defines the set of things that exist and how they interact.  In the physical world, some of those objects (e.g. observable matter) can be directly measured and manipulated, whereas other objects can only be observed via their influence on observable objects (e.g. gravity).  Because object-based thinking has direct analogues to how people often conceptualize the physical world, object-oriented programming can be intuitive to learn and implement.\n",
        "\n",
        "As an aside, the most popular \"alternative\" to object-oriented programming is called [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming).  The basic units of computation in functional programming languages are mathematical functions.  The idea of functional programming originated from [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus).  Functional programming techniques and approaches are beyond the scope of this course.\n",

For example, all of the courses' 'name' fields contained string objects; all of the instructors' 'courses' fields contained lists of course dictionary objects; and so on.  In other words, the general \"formats\" of different course dictionaries were similar to each other, and the formats of different instructor dictionaries were similar to each other.

        "- Define two new classes, `Course` and `Instructor`, and re-do the example used to explore dictionary objects.\n",
        "- Define some example biological classes that incorporate different properties, like `multicellular`, `breathes_oxygen`, `lays_eggs`, etc.  How can you support exceptions, such as the [duck-billed platypus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platypus) (a mammal that lays eggs)?\n",
        "- Modify the `Counter` class defined above to support addition and subtraction between different counters.  For example, if `a` and `b` are both `Counter` objects, `a` - `b` should yield a new instance of `Counter` object whose count is the either the difference between `a.count` and `b.count` or 0 (whichever is greater)."
