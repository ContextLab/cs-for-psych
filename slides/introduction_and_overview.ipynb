The contents of Jupyter notebooks are stored as .json (JavaScript Object Notation) files.  It's not super important that you familiarize yourself with the nitty-gritties of the .json format at this point in the course, but we'll revisit it later when we start working with data.\n",

If you are already familiar with Python and Jupyter notebooks, you might be interested in [this video](https://youtu.be/Gin8_AITmS0) summarizing some tips and tricks for writing good, clean, effective code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: this tutorial is intended to introduce you to the basics-- not to provide a complete, or even fully self-contained, overview of Python programming.  If this material is new to you, then after running through this notebook, I suggest that you work through a beginner Python tutorial like [this one](https://gitlab.erc.monash.edu.au/andrease/Python4Maths/tree/master/Intro-to-Python) .\n",
        "\n",
        "### What's a Jupyter notebook?\n",
        "For a more complete answer, check out [this video](https://youtu.be/CSkTJRNBTME).  The short answer is that a Jupyter notebook is an interactive tool that allows you to take notes, execute code, create figures, and easily share it all with other people.  Jupyter notebooks comprise a series of _cells_.  Each cell (looks like a rectangular block of text) in a notebook contains one of two basic categories of content:\n",
        "  1. **Markdown cells** (like the current cell) contain formatted text in the [Markdown text formatting language](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).  You can use these cells kind of like the code underlying text you'd write in a word processor.  What you type is what eventually appears on the screen.  For the most part, text in Markdown cells gets \"rendered\" (i.e. drawn on the screen) just as you write it.  However, you can also specify various formatting tweaks, like creating _italicized_ or **bolded** text, etc.  [This tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) provides a quick and gentle interactive introduction to Markdown.  You can create a new Markdown cell by pressing the \"+\" button in the toolbar and selecting \"Markdown\" from the dropdown list in the toolbar.\n",
        "  2. **Code cells** (like the next cell) contains computer code. A computer is like a fancy calculator; computer code is a set of instructions that tells the computer which things to do (and in which order).  You can create a new Code cell by pressing the \"+\" button in the toolbar and selecting \"Code\" from the dropdown list in the toolbar.\n",
        "  \n",
        "The text you type into a new notebook cell is a set of instructions that tell the notebook what to do when the cell is _run_ (i.e., transformed from a set of instructions into an executed set of actions).  To run a cell, hold the `shift` key and press `enter/return`.\n",
        "  - When you run a Markdown cell, the text is rendered with the formatting options you specify.  To see and/or edit the underlying code, simply double click on the rendered text.\n",
        "  - When you run a Code cell, the Python instructions you type in are run.  We'll explore what this means below.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Using Python like a calculator\n",
        "\n",
        "One way to think about Python is like a calculator.  For example, you can type in an equation, and when you \"run\" that line of code the answer is printed to the console window.  Play around with the examples below to explore (double click on code to edit it, and press `shift` + `return` to run it."
